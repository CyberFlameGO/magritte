package: "magritte"
type: "TrackingSubgraphGpu"

# A graph that performs motion tracking on detections. It's a wrapper around the
# MediaPipe object tracking subgraph.
#
# The input streams don't need to have the same timestamps. The detections
# stream can be at a lower rate (e.g., obtained from a video that was
# downsampled to a lower framerate). The output detection stream will be
# generated for the same timestamps as the input video packets.
#
# Inputs:
# - input_video: The GpuBuffer stream in which objects should be tracked. Its
#   motion will be analyzed for the tracking.
# - detections: The detections to be tracked.
#
# Outputs:
# - tracked_detections: Resulting tracked detections.
