package: "magritte"
type: "FaceOverlayLiveGpu"

# A graph that detects faces and draws debug information.
#
# It draws in red the raw detection output (detection box, keypoints, score),
# and in green the redacted area outline.
#
# This graph is specialized for GPU architectures. It also optimized for live
# streaming environments by throttling the input stream and by applying only
# full-range face detection.
#
# Inputs:
# - input_video: A GpuBuffer stream containing the image on which detection
#   models are run.
#
# Outputs:
# - output_video: A GpuBuffer stream containing the image annotated with
#   detection and redaction areas.
