# A graph that detects/tracks faces and blurs them using simple box blur.
#
# Note that simple blurring is not an effective de-identification method!
#
# The face detection supports all orientations and both short and full ranges.
#
# Once detected, moving faces are tracked with mediapipe object tracking.
#
# This graph is specialized for CPU architectures and live environments,
# tracking movements at a fixed frame rate of 5 fps.
#
# Inputs:
# - input_video: An ImageFrame stream containing the image on which detection
#   models are run.
#
# Outputs:
# - output_video: An ImageFrame stream containing the blurred image.
